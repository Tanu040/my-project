This project is a simple bank user page. It is made using only HTML and CSS. In this page, we can see the money balance at the top. Right now, it shows $0. 
Below the balance, there are two buttons. One button is green and says Deposit. The second button is red and says Withdraw. These buttons are made just for showing, they do not work because i did not add JavaScript.
The whole inner container is kept in the center of the screen. The inner container has white color, soft corners, and a small shadow to make it look nice. 
The green color is used to show money and deposit. Red color is used to show withdraw. The buttons are big and easy to press. They are also wide and placed one below the other.
This design also works well on mobile phones, tablets, and computers. If we open it in small screen or big screen, it still looks good. We used something called flexbox in CSS to center everything. 
This project is only for design. It does not do real banking work. It is helpful for learning HTML and CSS. We can learn how to make good looking pages, how to use buttons, text, colors, and how to center things. 
It is a nice and easy project for beginners to practice layout and styling.

Steps to do this:
First, open VS Code.
Make one file called index.html.
Make another file called styles.css.
In index.html, write the HTML code. It has one big box (inner container), inside that we show the balance using <h2> tag and two buttons using <button> tags.
In styles.css, write the CSS code to make it look nice.
We use Flexbox to keep the container in the center of the page.
We give white background to the inner container(div class), and shadow to make it look like a real card.
The balance is green color. Deposit button is green. Withdraw button is red.
Connect styles.css in the index.html using <link> tag.
